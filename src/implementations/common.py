    r"""Part of an evolutionary algorithm applying only the variation part
    (crossover **and** mutation). The modified individuals have their
    fitness invalidated. The individuals are cloned so returned population is
    independent of the input population.
    :param population: A list of individuals to vary.
    :param toolbox: A :class:`~deap.base.Toolbox` that contains the evolution
                    operators.
    :param cxpb: The probability of mating two individuals.
    :param mutpb: The probability of mutating an individual.
    :returns: A list of varied individuals that are independent of their
              parents.
    The variation goes as follow. First, the parental population
    :math:`P_\mathrm{p}` is duplicated using the :meth:`toolbox.clone` method
    and the result is put into the offspring population :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`.  A
    first loop over :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mate pairs of
    consecutive individuals. According to the crossover probability *cxpb*, the
    individuals :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{x}_{i+1}` are mated
    using the :meth:`toolbox.mate` method. The resulting children
    :math:`\mathbf{y}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{y}_{i+1}` replace their respective
    parents in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. A second loop over the resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mutate every individual with a
    probability *mutpb*. When an individual is mutated it replaces its not
    mutated version in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. The resulting :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`
    is returned.
    This variation is named *And* because of its propensity to apply both
    crossover and mutation on the individuals. Note that both operators are
    not applied systematically, the resulting individuals can be generated from
    crossover only, mutation only, crossover and mutation, and reproduction
    according to the given probabilities. Both probabilities should be in
    :math:`[0, 1]`.

    The algorithm takes in a population and evolves it in place using the
    :meth:`varAnd` method. It returns the optimized population and a
    :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` with the statistics of the evolution. The
    logbook will contain the generation number, the number of evaluations for
    each generation and the statistics if a :class:`~deap.tools.Statistics` is
    given as argument. The *cxpb* and *mutpb* arguments are passed to the
    :func:`varAnd` function. The pseudocode goes as follow ::
        evaluate(population)
        for g in range(ngen):
            population = select(population, len(population))
            offspring = varAnd(population, toolbox, cxpb, mutpb)
            evaluate(offspring)
            population = offspring
    As stated in the pseudocode above, the algorithm goes as follow. First, it
    evaluates the individuals with an invalid fitness. Second, it enters the
    generational loop where the selection procedure is applied to entirely
    replace the parental population. The 1:1 replacement ratio of this
    algorithm **requires** the selection procedure to be stochastic and to
    select multiple times the same individual, for example,
    :func:`~deap.tools.selTournament` and :func:`~deap.tools.selRoulette`.
    Third, it applies the :func:`varAnd` function to produce the next
    generation population. Fourth, it evaluates the new individuals and
    compute the statistics on this population. Finally, when *ngen*
    generations are done, the algorithm returns a tuple with the final
    population and a :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` of the evolution.
    .. note::
        Using a non-stochastic selection method will result in no selection as
        the operator selects *n* individuals from a pool of *n*.

    :meth:`toolbox.select` and :meth:`toolbox.evaluate` aliases to be
